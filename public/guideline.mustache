			<h1>Upload Guidelines</h1>
			<div style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify">
        <p><strong>We are happy for every user submitted photo, but there are a few guidelines to follow for everyone to have a great experience.</strong></p>
        <p>All uploaded images will be checked by an admin or a trusted member of the community. If anything slips through, please report it. We can be reached via the contact form <a href="/about">here</a> for any inquires.</p>
        <p>Any photo you upload <strong>must</strong> comply with german law. In particular <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/kunsturhg/__22.html">§22</a>
          , <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/kunsturhg/__23.html">§23</a> KunstUrhG.</p>
        <p>To make your submission fair and fun for everyone please follow these rules:<p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your photo must be taken from a real-world location and represent the location of the camera, not just the subject in the frame.</li>
          <li>Submissions must be recognizable and not overly ambiguous — the location should be guessable with reasonable context clues.</li>
          <li>If taken indoors, the location must be sufficiently unique or iconic to allow other players to reasonably deduce it.</li>
          <li>Avoid excessive zoom or framing that hides surroundings — the photo should help others infer where the camera was located.</li>
          <li>Do not upload photos that are heavily edited, filtered, or artificially generated (e.g., AI-generated scenes).</li>
          <li>Ensure no personally identifiable information or private property is clearly visible without permission.</li>
          <li>Only upload content you own or have the rights to share publicly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thank you for participating!</p>
